# My Resume


# Input
The tool accepts structured data inputs, encompassing the user's personal information, educational background, abilities, work experience, and project specifics. The data is directly inputted into the Resume.js file as variables or arrays for convenient processing. The program utilizes user-defined styles from Resume.css to personalize the resume's presentation.

# Process
The application employs React, a component-oriented JavaScript package, to dynamically generate the resume. The Resume.js file functions as the primary component, importing data and layout styles from Resume.css. The React development server interprets the input, utilizing JSX syntax for an organized and modular representation. The toolchain generates the code and incorporates the styles into an intuitive and responsive web application. The development server refreshes modifications instantaneously.

# Output
The result is an aesthetically pleasing, responsive online application that showcases the résumé. It complies with established stylistic rules, with a designated background color, black text, and structured sections for enhanced readability.
